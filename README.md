Please refer to https://github.com/accesio/deprecated/tree/master/APCI for the old project files.

ACCES is refactoring our Linux support, seeking to modernize and streamline our drivers and samples, and extend our list of supported programming languages to include modern dynamic languages (like Python, R, Java, etc).
The new Linux driver package for PCI and PCI Express devices, including PCI Express Mini Card and all similar members of the PCI bus Family, is located at https://github.com/accesio/linux-drivers.
This project also incorporates USB and drivers for ACCES Serial devices.
